Pen Grip Pose Detection based on MideaPipe

# WKUCPS-4951-G10 Pen Grip Pose Detection based on MediaPipe

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a hand pose detection model using MediaPipe, capable of detecting gestures and providing suggestions. The primary goal is to create a robust system that can analyze hand gestures in real-time and offer feedback.

## Project Steps
1. **Gesture Data Collection**: We wrote code to capture hand gestures and collect relevant parameters.
2. **Data Collection**: We gathered a substantial amount of both correct and incorrect hand gesture data to train our model effectively.
3. **Parameter Analysis and Model Development**: Utilizing MediaPipe, we analyzed the collected parameters and developed a hand pose detection model.
4. **Functionality Implementation**: We implemented functions such as providing suggestions and real-time monitoring based on the model's output.
5. **User Interface Design**: A user interaction interface was designed to provide a user-friendly experience.

## Approach
Our team adopted a top-down shooting angle for image capture, ensuring optimal detection accuracy.

## Directory Structure
- **Data Editing**: Contains scripts for data preprocessing.
- **Project Code**: Includes the main codebase for the project.
- **Other Code**: Houses additional scripts related to gesture capture and data analysis.
- **Data Analysis Results**: Stores the results obtained from data analysis.

## Project Versions
The project directory includes four versions of our code:
1. **Version 1**: The initial version involved basic implementation directly on the camera feed.
2. **Version 2**: Added functionality for providing suggestions.
3. **Version 3**: Integrated a user interaction interface using Tkinter.
4. **Final Version**: Code has been refactored into modular components for easier maintenance and future development by subsequent teams.

## Usage
To experience the project, simply launch the final version for the best performance.
